A simple voting app done in React.js (from Full Stack React).
The user can view products by # of upvotes, and vote on a product by clicking on the caret icon.

In order to run the app, run `npm install` and boot up the HTTP server by running `npm run server`.
The browser should open up a new window with the app running on [localhost:3000](localhost:3000).
